I finally got around to starting this. Due to the coronavirus, I've had unprecedented amounts of free time.\
So, a little about me: I'm in school, and I enjoy programming in C and Python. I'm actually working on creating a programming language, so some of my posts will likely be about that. I also enjoy math. I'm thinking about creating a (very) simple [CAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra_system) and using my aforementioned language to script it.\
I'll also post about general items of interest. For example, I just read about Fractran, and I'll probably whip up an interpreter for that and share it with you.\
As for frequency of posting, that's going to depend a lot on my schedule. As I said, I'm in school.\
If anyone has feedback or a topic they'd like me to post about, feel free to [email me](mailto:rzach@outlook.com).
