### The Project
I intend to create a physics engine using HTML ```<canvas>``` and vanilla JS.

### Motivation
I'm in a physics class right now, so I want to be able to simulate some of the experiments we're doing and concepts we're learning.
I also want to learn JavaScript so I can get into web development.

### Why Vanilla JS?
All I need is a simple graphics interface and the ability to do math. I can accomplish both with plain JavaScript.

### Other Things I Might Do With This
If this works well enough, I'll make it into a real library.
I might try to create a DSL (I'll have to look more into this).

### Updates
Updates will be given in individual posts.
