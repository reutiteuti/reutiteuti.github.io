<div class="about">
  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>I'm currently in high school. My interests include computer science, politics, math, physics, reading, and to some extent, linguistics, psychology, and philosophy.</p>
  <hr/>
  <h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>I have no formal computer science education unless you count a semester of AP Computer Science Principles. I am mostly self-taught.</p>
  <p>So if my code is bad, <em>please criticize it,</em> but constructively.</p>
