<div class="about">
  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>I'm currently in high school. My interests include computer science, politics, math, and physics.</p>
  <p>I enjoy writing C and I'm working on an interpreter for the Forth language.</p>
  <p>When I'm done with that I plan on creating a programming language of my own and transpiling it to Forth.</p>
  <p>If anyone is impressed with my work and wants to hire me, please feel free to <a href="mailto:rzach@outlook.com">contact me by email.</a> Please note I am only able to accept remote work at this time.</p>
  <hr/>
  <h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>I have no formal computer science education unless you count a semester of AP Computer Science Principles. I am mostly self-taught.</p>
  <p>So if my code is bad, <em>please criticize it,</em> but constructively.</p>
